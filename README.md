# NBA-Time-Leap-10-Seasons
## Background Information
One of the ways the National Basketball Association differs from the other major league sports is the size of each team. Each roster has 14 available spots and 5 players on the court at once; this leaves a lot of room for both scrutiny and praise. Since the ball is being passed around so much and players are getting a good amount of touches, it is easier for sports analysts to then compare these current players to players of the past. Whether it is an all-time great of a player that has declined quickly with age, these analysts make their inferences. The issue seen with this tactic, is the predictions are all on a basis of visual (play style, defensive focus) and speculation (reported activities, life habits). This doesnâ€™t prove to be a viable source of prediction; in order to remedy that, the goal of this project is to use data science to better predict the life cycle of a younger player in the NBA. 
Approach the Problem
## The problem is split into six different steps;
1. Defining Data Source / Wrangling Data
2. Cleaning / Formatting Data
3. K-Means Clustering (1st round)
4. Auto-Regression Prediction
5. Re-Clustering Post Prediction
6. Visualizing the Results
